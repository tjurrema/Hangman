The name of this project is Hangman.

The idea is to make a native app, where the user can play a game to guess a word the computer have picked.

####Features of the app:
* if you open the app, the gameplay must start
* display placeholders for the letters that the user didn't guessed
* the app must inform the user how many chances the user has before losing the game
* should have a on screen keyboard
* only accepts letters and isn't case sensitive
* has two settings, the user can choose how many chances he want to have and how long the word must be
* has highscores of the best 10 results
* you should see the letters the user have typed in.

The app would be a Android App and I write Hangman in Java. 


#### mockups:
* homescreen, with buttons to:  - start a new game
                                - rules
                                - settings
                                - highscores
                                - quiet
* every page has a toolbar with a menu button, so you can you go to the homescreen.
* settings page, that the user can choose how many letters the word should have and how many options the user has.
* highscores page, there you see the top ten of the users best scores.
* rules page, the explain the rules of Hangman.
* game page, here should you the how long the word is that the user should guess, how many chances the user has 
  left, a keyboard should appear and you should see what the user already typed in.
* Winner and a Game over Page
